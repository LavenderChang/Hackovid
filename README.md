### !! This is not the final version !!

#### you can access all code via unzip everything in a file~
#### (Due to the file size and file amount limit, we can't upload a single file which contain everything.)

### main.py will be executable.

By the way, since we hadn't finish our code, we haven't pack it into executable app yet,

(Unlike to Tower-defending games or shooting games, the story plays extremely important role in RPGs)

(We don't tend to pack our program with story unfinished.)

but you can run it in PyCharm or JupitarNotebook.

( It's such a big project! We have done a lot but there is still more for us to deal with.)
