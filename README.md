# Hackovid

## !!! THE LATEST VERSION IS IN hackovid_1.0.0.zip !!!

## 8/18 update

### All work is done!!

### After finishing all our works, the file size will be over 100 mb, which is larger than github's limit. To deal with this problem, we take the venv out of our file. To run successfully, do "pip install pygame", "pip install numpy", "pip install opencv-python" and "pip install ffpyplayer". 

## 8/11 update

### We've found that github Destop allows us to upload a bigger file, so you can just unzip hackovid.zip to get everything.

## 8/10 update

#### you can access all code via unzip everything in a file~
#### (Due to the file size and file amount limit, we can't upload a single file which contain everything.)

### main.py will be executable.

By the way, since we hadn't finish our code, we haven't pack it into executable app yet,

(Unlike to Tower-defending games or shooting games, the story plays extremely important role in RPGs)

(We don't tend to pack our program with story unfinished.)

but you can run it in PyCharm or JupitarNotebook.

( It's such a big project! We have done a lot but there is still more for us to deal with.)
